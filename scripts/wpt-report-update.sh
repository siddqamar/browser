# Build/refresh the WPT coverage report over the testable areas (the AREAS allowlist below — the
# engine is a CSS/DOM/HTML layout engine, so we run the areas it actually implements and skip the
# ~180 WPT areas for features it has no code for). All artifacts live under ONE directory,
# wpt-report/ (gitignored):
#   wpt-report/results/   per-test result store (one JSON per test, written live as tests finish)
#   wpt-report/site/      generated multi-page HTML (one index.html per directory)
#   wpt-report/index.html entry point (redirects into site/) — open this in a browser
#
# Results stream into the store as the run progresses (via wpt's mozlog --log-raw), so you can watch
# them land: the HTML is regenerated periodically during a full run, and you can also rebuild it any
# time with `scripts/wpt-report.py wpt-report/results wpt-report`.
#
#   scripts/wpt-report-update.sh css/css-grid/foo.html [more tests/dirs...]
#       Re-run just those test(s)/dir(s); their result files are overwritten in the store and the
#       HTML is rebuilt. Fast — no need to re-run the whole suite.
#
#   scripts/wpt-report-update.sh --full
#       RESUME: run every test in the allowlisted areas NOT already in the store, streaming results
#       in and regenerating the HTML periodically. Restarting (e.g. to change parallelism) keeps
#       prior results and only runs what's left — it never wipes the store. The full testable suite
#       is large (tens of thousands of files, hours of wall-clock); run repeatedly until complete.
#
#   scripts/wpt-report-update.sh --fresh
#       Wipe the store and run the ENTIRE testable suite (all allowlisted areas) from scratch.
#
# Tunables (env): WPT_PROCESSES (parallel runners, default 16), WPT_TIMEOUT_MULT (per-test timeout
# multiplier, default 0.5 — most of our timeouts are unsupported features, so a shorter clock trims
# the tail without losing real passes).
#
# Uses $WEBDRIVER_BIN if set/executable, else target/release/webdriver (so it won't rebuild the
# engine every call); run-wpt.sh builds one if neither exists.

# Testable top-level WPT areas. The engine is a CSS/DOM/HTML layout engine (V8 + basic fetch +

# workers, IndexedDB, crypto, sensors, …) and would only pile up timeout/error noise. Allowlist the

# grows. No --test-types filter, so reftests run too — that's most of the CSS signal.
