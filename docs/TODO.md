# Feature backlog (non-CSS)

See also docs/CSS-TODO.md for the CSS backlog.

## Web / JS APIs
- [ ] **FetchData** — (requested by user) form/data serialization for fetch. Likely `FormData`
      (`new FormData(form)`, `.append/.get/.getAll/.entries`, iterate) so forms can be submitted
      via `fetch(url, { method, body: formData })`; also wire `<form>` submit to build it.
      Confirm exact scope with user.
