//! JavaScript runtime (Phase: scripting).
//!
//! Wraps Google's V8 JavaScript engine behind our own small API so the engine could be swapped
//! later — same pattern as `net`/ureq and `paint`/fontdue. Nothing outside this crate knows V8
//! exists. V8 gives us full JS speed plus complete language support, including real ES modules
//! and dynamic `import()`.
//!
//! ## V8 integration shape
//! - V8 is process-global-initialized exactly once (`std::sync::Once`).
//! - A V8 `Isolate` is single-thread-bound, so every entry point that owns an isolate either runs
//!   on the calling thread ([`Runtime`]) or creates the isolate on a dedicated worker thread
//!   ([`eval_batch`]/[`run_with_dom`]/[`run_modules`]).
//! - Native callbacks in V8 are bare C function pointers and cannot capture Rust state. We share
//!   the page DOM and console buffer with them through a [`HostState`] stored on the **context
//!   slot** (`Context::set_slot`/`get_slot`), retrieved inside each callback via
//!   `scope.get_current_context().get_slot::<HostState>()`. The DOM is only ever touched on the
//!   isolate's own thread, so `Rc<RefCell<dom::Document>>` is fine (no `Send` needed).
//!
//! ## DOM exposure
//! Rather than port dozens of bespoke per-node wrapper closures, we expose a *small* set of native
//! primitive functions on `globalThis`, keyed by integer node ids (`dom::NodeId` is a `usize`),
//! and build the `document`/element objects in JavaScript on top of them (the
//! `DOCUMENT_BOOTSTRAP`, `TIMERS_BOOTSTRAP`, and `BROWSER_ENV_BOOTSTRAP` strings). All the
//! framework-compatibility machinery (per-node wrapper cache + expandos, `style`/`classList`/
//! `dataset` write-through, the DOM interface class hierarchy + `instanceof`, navigator/location/
//! storage/observers, the timer/event loop) lives in that reused, engine-agnostic JavaScript.

// out of band and it isn't surfaced to the worker), so author rules from external sheets do not
// affect these computed values. That's fine for feature-detection, which probes inline styles on
// throwaway elements — it never relies on external CSS.

  // Generic HTML IDL attribute reflection.
  //
  // The HTML standard defines, for each element interface, a set of IDL attributes that "reflect"
  // a content attribute (e.g. `el.id` <-> `id`, `a.href` <-> `href`, `input.disabled` <->
  // `disabled`). Each reflected attribute has a TYPE (DOMString, boolean, long, unsigned long,
  // enumerated, URL, ...) whose getter/setter rules are spelled out in the spec. We implement those
  // rules once as a set of "type factories" and drive them from data tables transcribed from the
  // WPT `elements-*.js` files (which are themselves generated from the spec IDL), so the behaviour
  // matches the exhaustive reflection-*.html conformance tests.
  //
  // Every getter/setter reads/writes the element's CONTENT attribute through the existing
  // __getAttr / __setAttr / __removeAttr natives, so reflection stays live both ways (set IDL ->
  // attribute changes; setAttribute -> IDL getter changes).
