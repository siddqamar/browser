//! Stackful coroutines for generators (and async functions), built on OS threads.
//!
//! lumen is a tree-walking interpreter, so suspending a generator mid-body means parking its native
//! call stack. Each generator gets its own OS thread; control is handed back and forth with a pair of
//! channels in strict ping-pong — exactly one of {driver, generator thread} runs at any instant, the
//! other parked in `recv`. The shared [`Interp`] is therefore never touched concurrently, which is
//! why shuttling a `*mut Interp` across the thread boundary (see [`InterpPtr`]) is sound in practice.
//!
//! The running generator's channels live in a thread-local [`YIELDER`], so a `yield` buried deep in
//! eval finds the right channel and nested generators (each on their own thread) need no extra
//! bookkeeping — every thread reads its own thread-local.
//!
//! Address stability: a generator never outlives the `Engine` that owns the interpreter, and that
//! `Engine` is not moved between the `eval` calls that create and drive the generator, so the
//! captured pointer stays valid for the coroutine's whole life.
